When someone says what is Redis, we also presume it to be a cache. But when you dig deep into their site, you realize it is an ecosystem of storage solutions. In addition to simple K-V store, it supports a wide range of different data types. It has persistance which is highly configurable. Also there are other data paradigms supported such as Pub/Sub, Streams etc.

# Redis as a cache

## Pre-requisite: Caching strategies

Before we go further, here is a primer on different caching strategies:

1. Write-behind cache
    
2. Write-through cache
    
3. Cache-aside
    
4. Read-through cache
    

### Cache-aside

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1708795242526/92e7fbf5-b899-4197-9d4a-a4ce439e2b6f.png align="left")

Most popular caching strategy where cache is a fast storage layer and application server takes read/write to storage based on cache response.

1. If **Cache Hit**: Read from *cache*
    

* If **Cache Miss**
    
    2\. Read from *database*
    
* 3\. Write to *cache*
    

### Write-through cache

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1708795275970/383aca04-458a-4d31-ae16-614f368f1541.png align="left")

Here the cache is in middle of application and database. And all write happen through cache to database **at exact time**

### Write-behind cache

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1708795353029/08c5a05d-f5d4-4f06-abb5-32365b275707.png align="center")

Similar to *Write-through cache*, cache is in between application and database. But the key difference is that cache batches up writes coming from application and flushes to database at a later time.

### Read-through cache

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1708795407849/2ac40c88-d5b8-4540-a6f5-e26ff7447928.png align="center")

Cache comes in between application and database, but the reads are the operation that occurs here which are driven from database.

1. Read from database and store in cache
    
2. Serve the data to application from the cache This is useful when the database has a lot of data that needs to be read from the application which do not change over time.

# Redis persistance

We are all aware of Redis as a in-memory store which is a volatile memory(gets erased when server is shutdown); but there are persistence mechanisms by which you can store data on disk. This is similar to Write-ahead logs found in traditional databases where the series of transactions are stored as a log file in various formats (UNDO, REDO etc) In Redis, there are 3 ways of persisting data to durable storage

1. Redis Database (RDB)
    
2. Append-only file (AOF)
    
3. RDB+AOF
    

## Pre-requisite: Copy-on-write on Linux

## RDB

This takes a snapshots of the Redis instance at sampling intervals.

## AOF

AOF persists every write operation that has occurred in Redis. As it has every operation detail, this file offers the advantage to refreshing the Redis to the current state if the server shuts down. But this comes at the expense of large AOF size as *there ain't no free lunch*

Comparison matrix of RDB and AOF

| Metric | RDB | AOF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Size | Smaller as it is snapshot | Bigger as every write operation persists |
| Data loss | Can happen for data in between snapshot interval | No data loss as everything is logged |
| Server restart | Very fast as RDB file is small and is parsed faster compared to AOF | Slower as AOF is bigger |
| `fork()` and `fsync()` | RDB does Linux's `fork()` to persist under child process. | Similar to Postgres implementation of `fsync` for snapshot ting, ADB uses `fsync` syscall for persisting into ADB file |

## Combining RDB and AOF

# Redis as a Database: ACID and other things

Redis is an in-memory but can act as a database by providing ACID compliance

* Partial ACID: As it is single-threaded it guarantees **consistency** and **isolation**
    
* Full ACID if AOF `appendfsync always` is used. As AOF is written to disk; Atomicity and Durability are guaranteed as AOF can be used to power up Redis to the stable state before the server crash occurred
    

## Atomicity

> All transaction should happen or not **atomically**

Redis provides **ATOMICITY** if AOF `appendfsync always` is used.

## Consistency

> How the data is **consistent**. What data has been persisted should be read **consistently**

Redis provides this out-of-the-box as it is single-threaded. In Multi-node Redis setup; Redis provides consistency via Master-Slave architecture. In Active-Active (aka Master-Master) setup, Redis is able to achieve by using CRDT ([Link](https://redis.com/blog/diving-into-crdts/)).

## Isolation

> How **isolated** is the row when concurrently upsert/delete commands occur

Redis provides this out-of-the-box as it is single-threaded (except for I/O in Redis 6)

## Durability

> How **durable** is database in event of failure like machine crashes etc without loosing write

Redis provides **ATOMICITY** if AOF `appendfsync always` is used. Database provides Durability via Write-ahead-logs whilst Redis does this by AOF or RDB as discussed before.

## Availability

> The database transaction (read, write) is returned by database and is **available** to consumer

## Concurrency control

> How **concurrent** transactions are **controlled**. For example, a user David data is being updated by 2 transactions. We need *optimistic* or *pessimistic* concurrency control

Redis has `WATCH` command

# Redis as a Streaming

## Redis Streams

Inspired by Event Sourcing systems with Append-only logs, Redis provides a data structure **Redis Streams** to facilitate event-driven architecture.

Similar to Kafka, Flink; Redis also has concept of Message Broker with Consumer groups. Consuming groups and consumer

An example of creating a Redis Stream, Consumer Group and Read for a Consumer

```bash
// Create Redis Stream `Redis_Stream_Example` with data
> XADD Redis_Stream_Example * name "AymanPatel" age 54 gender "MALE" sessionId 433
"1708792289107-0"

// Create Consumer Group `redis_consumer-group`
> XGROUP CREATE Redis_Stream_Example redis_consumer_group $
"OK"


// Add data `Selena`
> XADD Redis_Stream_Example * name "Selena" age 14 gender "FEMALE" sessionId 431 
"1708792778677-0"

// Create a reader which reads new data `Selena`
> XREADGROUP GROUP redis_consumer_group consumer1 STREAMS Redis_Stream_Example >
1) 1) "Redis_Stream_Example"
   2) 1) 1) "1708792778677-0"
         2) 1) "name"
            2) "AymanPatel"
            3) "age"
            4) "54"
            5) "gender"
            6) "MALE"
            7) "sessionId"
            8) "433"
```

1. **Add data to Redis Stream**

## Redis Pub/Sub

Similar to radio broadcast, a Broadcaster can **PUBLISH** a message to Redis, whilst subscribers can **SUBSCRIBE** to messages

Can check via Redis Insights

# Redis Search

> RedisSearch is a Secondary Index & Full-text Search

## Full-text Search

Alternative to Apache Solr (OSS), Algolia (SaaS) to provide text-search capability over data stored in Redis

Redis's documentation site is powered by RedisStack which includes Redis's full text search.

## Secondary Index

Database has ability to index non-primary keys for faster retrieval using the Secondary Index. [Oracle documentation on Secondary index](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17275_01/html/programmer_reference/am_second.html)

Redis provides a plethora of commands for working via `FT` commands.

* [Link to RedisSearch methods](https://redis.io/commands/?group=search)
    

Redis Search also has other building blocks for creating full-text systems such as

* [Aggregations](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/aggregations/) such as `GROUPBY`, `FILTER`, `SORT` etc
    
* [Stop words](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/stopwords/): Discarding stop-words (a, an, the etc) to improve search performance
    
* [Tokenization](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/escaping/): Destructure sentence into words for individual storage
    
* Stemming: Coagulating same-meaning words as one. Example: Study can be studying, studied etc and can be store as study only
    
* and much more
    

# Document Database with RedisJSON

Mongo had become popular to store data as JSON BLOBs in the 2010s. This was useful in many e-commerce applications to store database as a JSON store which can be served directly via an API without need to do database JOINs or serializing/deserializing while serving. Note that this use-case became less popular as ACID is not necessarily guaranteed.

# Redis as a Vector Database

> [What is a Vector Database](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/) by Pinecone

In the age of ChatGPT and LLMs, a new type of database has emerged called Vector databases. These databases store any type of data in vector(numeric) format which can lead to semantic meaning of correlated data nearer to each other which can be used by LLM to gain Long-term memory and increasing its context window. Redis can be used as a vector embedding to store vectors via Redis server and RedisJSON. [Read more about Redis Vector setup here](https://redis.io/docs/get-started/vector-database/#set-a-vector-database-up)

> Note that this is a hacky approach. For better Vector databases look into [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) etc

# Extending Redis

# Conclusion

When I started digging into Redis, I realised how diverse is it in its toolset. It may still be a cache; but making it work with other design paradigms just shows how well the architecture and abstraction of Redis is.

Also, one more thing. Cache is just a catch-all term that requires nuance; so keep that in mind :)
