üî• A new minimalistic Python implementation to creating web apps!

FastHTML, which can be started with a 6-line Python script. But can scale in creating complex web applications with no full-page reloads thanks to HTMX.  
  
üöÄ It is small and fast thanks to leveraging:  
  
1\. HTMX: For enhancing HTML to bring rich client applications. HTMX also allows to bring HATEOAS as first-class citizen for end-to-end applications perspective.  
2\. ASGI: Implementing the ASGI spec for concurrency. ASGI spec is implemented by using Uvicorn and Starlette.  
  
üè¢ Deployment Targets:  
1\. Vercel  
2\. Railway  
3\. Hugging face and more
