## User Space vs Kernel Space

In order to understand where eBPF comes into the picture, first we need to understand the basic difference of **User Space vs Kernel Space**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704646362259/9fb24659-07df-4520-9152-bd2d9db04f68.jpeg align="left")

eBPF fits into the kernel space; but giving a user-space analogy of the significance of eBPF to the Operating System would be what WASM was for the browser. WASM allowed applications to be written in non-javascript to be interpreted in the browser. It allowed products like Figma to be developed for the web. Sketch and Invision would not be able keep up with the power of Figma's powerful editor. Good news is that eBPF for its revolutionary and novel will aid in observing the kernel space and not bring any technologies on its knees.

## Why eBPF

Say you want to look into what is happening inside the Linux; I mean really look into the nuts and bolts; you might use an interface from User Space that can talk to Kernel Space which would give information such as `File IO`, `Network Traces` etc. but this would cause 2 issues

1. Any unexpected crash at the Kernel Space level can lead to lack of observability on root cause of failure
    
2. As it is an interface, the hardware or other Kernel Level details could not be visible from User Space
    

That is where eBPF comes in and shines. It is a sort of Virtual Machine that hooks up inside the Kernel which allows visibility to the User Space from the Kernel. This opens up the pandora's box of possibilities of logging, instrumentation and security applications that could leverage eBPF.

## History of BPF and eBPF

eBPF's name has been derived from a old technology called as BPF (Berkely Packet Filter).

### BPF

BPF was first conceived in early 1990s (before Linux became mainstream) as a way to intercept network traffic from the kernel itself instead of relying on user-level processes. It was a **network tap** (monitor network traffic) and **packet filter** (filtering out unwanted packets to reduce noise in netowrk monitoring)

### eBPF

> Video Recommendation : [eBPF: Unlocking the Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb_vD3XZYOA)

In early 2010s, there was a need for having better observability tools that could be defined in a software instead of hardware. Also, all the things that things that went from User Space to Kernel Space could crash unexpectedly without actually knowing what caused the crash at the Kernel space layer. Alexie wanted something that an application at User Space could call which would be a hook/probe-point to the Kernel which would further make a decision to send information to the User space. This is where eBPF was born.

## eBPF Architecture

eBPF programs are called by hooks/probes either by Kernel or the user-land application. These hooks are pre-defined are include

1. System calls
    
2. Function entry/exit: Custom Programs can attach to entry/exit functions so that they can run at these scenarios.
    
3. Kernel Tracepoints: Tracepoints are lightweight hooks to call a function at runtime. It is used for tracing and perf analysis at the kernel.
    
4. Network interfaces via XDP: eXpress Data Path (XDP) allows custom programs to attach to eBPF which can execute these custom program when the network packets are received.
    
5. LSI Module interface etc.
    

If the hook/probe are not available for particular use-case; it is possible to attach probes to eBPF at both user and kernel levels. These are called `uprobe` and `kprobe` respectively.

### Loading

Before a BPF can be run on the kernel; it requires to be **Loaded** with the help of some eBPF loader libraries:

1. [eBPF by Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf): Go-based eBPF loading library
    
2. [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf)
    

### Verification

Need to ensure that the eBPF program is safe to run It make sure that it follows various conditions such as:

1. Program is run by priveleged eBPF program (unless stated otherwise)
    
2. Program does not bring the system down
    
3. Program **always run to completion**
    

### JIT Compilation

Translating the eBPF bytecode (generated at **User Space**) into machine-readable code.

### eBPF Maps

These are required to hold and retrieve data. These hold wide variety of data such as

1. Hash Tables
    
2. Arrays
    
3. Stack traces
    
4. etc...
    

### Helper calls

eBPF do not call kernel functions directly in order to make eBPF loosely couple with Kernel versions. eBPF call function calls to pre-defined helper functions defined by the kernel. These helper functions include:

1. Current time and date
    
2. Process/cgroup context
    
    1. cgroups are basically isolation of processes, CPU, N/W for separate containers
        
3. Network packet manipulation and forwarding logic
    
4. Random number generator
    

### Tail and Function Calls

eBPF allows tail call of other eBPF functions which allows for compatibility and extendability of eBPF programs

### Ensuring eBPF is safe

As eBPF is a very powerful concept, which allows user-level programs to hook into kernel level details; it is imperative that the architecture of eBPF ensures that such a technology does not break the system when used.

#### Writing safe eBPF programs

This includes

1. eBPF programs should be non-blocking. eBPF program can contain a loop if and only if, the **Verifier** can ensure that loop exits!
    
2. eBPF programs do not use out-of-bounds memory
    
3. eBPF programs should be small
    
4. eBPF
    

#### Hardening eBPF

1. Kernel memory inside a eBPF program is read-only.
    
2. Spectre migration: Spectre was a big vulnerability in CPU architecture which allowed for out-of-order branch execution which lead to sensitive data access to attackers. eBPF prevents Spectre-type attacks at the **Verifier** level
    
3. Constant Binding

## Networking

Networking use-cases for eBPF include doing **Traffic Control**, controlling **network policy** (via XDP) etc Tools:

* [Calico Networking](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/operations/ebpf/use-cases-ebpf)
    
* [Cilium's CNI](https://cilium.io/use-cases/cni/)
    

## Observability

Send Kernel Level details to observability platform

* [Grafana Beyla](https://github.com/grafana/beyla) allows instrumentation of HTTP and HTTPS services from the Linux kernel to Grafana directly.
    
* [Cilium's Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble/)
    

## Tracing

Want to look into production tracing and troubleshooting. [BPFTrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) is the tool for you

If wanted to know how the `VACUUM` process is happening in Postgres under-the-hood. BPFTrace can help with that! Check this [article to monitor Postgres's VACUUM process](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace)

List of eBPF based tracing tools

1. [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) (Toolkit for creating kernel tracing tools)
    
2. [BPFTrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace)
    

## Security

Traditionally, [auditd](https://linux.die.net/man/8/auditd) was used for auditing things happening in the Linux OS; but as it is user-space component; there is some performance penalty.

Low-level observability through eBPF can aid in finding alerts for kernel level changes by attackers. For example, when application changes privileges are changed it can trigger an alert to a listening eBPF custom program

Security Libraries that are based on eBPF

1. [Tetragon](https://tetragon.io/)
    
2. [KubeArmour](https://kubearmor.com/): K80based Security engine which used eBPF and Linux Security Modules (LSM)
    
3. Falco
