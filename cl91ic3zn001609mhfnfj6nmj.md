# Rust being introduced to Linux kernel
Rust is planned to be introduced in Linux kernel version 6.1
Things being written in Rust include the NVMe driver and 9P Protocol. 9P protocol is used in remote filesystems such as NixOS, WSL and QEMU.
Things that have lesser chance of being written in Rust includes compilers and device drivers.

This allows to create caching or proxies on the edge to deliver server side calls on edge network with latency in milliseconds

# Akka changes license moves away from Open Source license
It has now adopted BSL license which is a "Source available" license that allows code to be open for developement and non-production usecases such as testing. Other companies using BSL include Senty, Couchbase, CockroachDB and lastly MariaDB(creator of BSL)
This movement from core OSS licenses to less open-source licenses has been happening for quite some time with likes of MongoDB and Elastic switching in the last few years.
