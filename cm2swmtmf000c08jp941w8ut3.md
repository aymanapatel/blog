ðŸ¤” Want to upgrade Java, Spring Boot versions is a methodical way  
  
There is a platform for that!  
  
ðŸ’¡ Moderne's OpenRewrite platform helps with managing complexities in upgrading your Java based projects  
  
Some common use cases include:  
1\. Upgrading to Java 17  
2\. Upgrading Spring Boot 2 to Spring Boot 3  
  
ðŸ™‹Why a tool?  
Knowing the API changes in libraries for every dependency is difficult. Also, a lot of time can be wasted in a particular solution that does not work well with a particular dependency.  
  
ðŸ”§How does it work?  
  
You can import custom recipes as Maven/Gradle task and run them.  
For example, you want to migrate from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5, you can import a recipe for it in Gradle like this:

```java
activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.testing.junit5.JUnit5BestPractices")
```

And run the gradle task:

```java
gradlew rewriteRun
```

Since these recipes are chainable, you can add steps to make code changes incrementally.  
Other features include:  
1\. Writing your own custom [recipes](https://docs.openrewrite.org/authoring-recipes/recipe-development-environment) for your use-case  
2\. Dashboard to track the recipes done in your project to track your level of completion of version migration.
